# coding_problems
My solutions for common coding problems/
The problems are from leetcode and as of 29/04 contain easy and medium difficulty problems 
from leetcodes April 30-day coding challenge and easy and medium interview sets.

The code is intended to be minimally commented and as short as possible. Try to read it 
as an exercise (this is what I do as well)

The vast majority of the problems are implemented optimally 
(as of 29/04 only bst from preorder is O(nlogn) when it can be done in O(n))
